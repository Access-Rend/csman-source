## How to build a package for CovScript?
```sh
csman install cics.csbuild
```
[CSBuild System](https://github.com/covscript/csbuild) Can help you building a CovScript Package easily.
```sh
# Build a Package
csbuild init package
# Build an Extension
csbuild init extension
```
After initialization, you can find `csman.json` in your current directory which created by csbuild. It seems like this:
```json
{
    "company.package_name": {
        "Description": "Write a brief description about your package in a line",
        "Author": "Anonymous",
        "Verizon": [
            "1.0"
        ],
        "Latest": "1.0",
        "Nightly": null,
        "ContentUrl": "Package Url in server"
    }
}
```
And you can also find a directory named `1.0`, 
you can change it to your own version but remember to change the version in `csman.json` above. 
If you don't, CSMAN will can not found your package description.  
In this directory, you can found another `csman.json` seems like this:
```json
{
    "State": "Preview",
    "Dependencies": {
        "cs.runtime": "latest"
    },
    "Contents": {
    }
}
```
About this file, please refer to [CSMAN.INFO](http://csman.info/).  
When you finish these two files, run `csbuild make` in package directory. 
Then you will get a zip file named `PACKAGENAME_VERSION` and a JSON file also named `PACKAGENAME_VERSION`. 
Please upload to your server, and fill the actual url of your zip file to `ContentUrl` field of `csman.json`.
